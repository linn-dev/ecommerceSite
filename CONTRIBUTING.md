# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing! A few quick guidelines to get started:

- Fork the repository and open a pull request against `main`.
- Keep PRs small and focused; include a clear description of changes and why they're needed.
- Follow the existing code style and run linters/tests where applicable.
- For larger changes, open an issue first to discuss the approach.

If you'd like help getting started, open an issue and tag it `good first issue`.
